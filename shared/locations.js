// The physical rooms the programme teaches in.
//
// Used by the Contact page (map + directions) and the 3D World page (walkthrough
// picker). One definition rather than two, because the moment they disagree the
// map sends a visitor to a different floor than the label promises.
//
// On the map fields: `mapEmbed` comes from Google Maps' own Share -> Embed a map,
// and the opaque `pb` string carries a place ID. That matters — an embed built
// from bare coordinates makes Google reverse-geocode the point, and for the CDLC
// it resolved to "Lomalan Coffee", the nearest business. Coordinates identify a
// spot; only the place ID identifies the place.
//
// `mapDestination` is a name rather than a place ID because the directions URL
// (`?api=1`) expects a ChIJ-style ID, while the embed exposes only the older
// 0x... form. Naming the place makes Google resolve it correctly; both names
// below were checked by opening the URL and reading the destination field.
